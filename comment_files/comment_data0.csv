Here are some notes and quotes for the lazy folks.

Key Takeaways
‚Ä¢ What the ‚Ä¶ ? Zuck and Lex are hundreds of miles apart but appear to each other as photorealistic codec avatars in 3D with spatial audio
‚Ä¢ In addition to being photorealistic, it's also more bandwidth-efficient than traditional video transmission
‚Ä¢ ""Perfection doesn't lead to immersion, it's the  nuances in facial expressions, including freckles, wrinkles, eye movements, and asymmetry."" - Lex Fridman
‚Ä¢ How is the metaverse different from a video call?
‚Ä¢ It feels like you are in the same room
‚Ä¢ You can do physical activities together like play games and have meetings
‚Ä¢ Quest 3 will be the first mainstream mixed-reality device
‚Ä¢ Quest Pro, released earlier, was pricier, but Quest 3 is more affordable at $500
‚Ä¢ Future glasses may seamlessly combine holograms with the physical environment
‚Ä¢ If a lot of people are interacting only with our digital version, then who are we really?
‚Ä¢ Are we what's driving the avatar or the avatar?
‚Ä¢ ""We want the world to evolve in a way where there isn't a single AI superintelligence, but where a lot of people are empowered by having AI tools to do their jobs and make their lives better."" - Mark Zuckerberg
‚Ä¢ Meta's vision is to create various AI companions tailored for different purposes:
‚Ä¢ Some will be more assistant oriented like the one they are building now simply called meta AI
‚Ä¢ There will also be AI's for consumer support, telling jokes, playing Baldur's Gate with you
‚Ä¢ Gif Dogg: Mark mentioned an internally tested text-based adventure AI that serves as a dungeon master, and one of the AI avatars is 
SnoopDogg
‚Ä¢ There's no specific release date for LLama 3
‚Ä¢ They are currently focused on integrating Llama 2 into consumer products and making it ready for widespread use
‚Ä¢ The subjective experience of reality and consciousness is what defines what is real, and technology provides a means to enhance and alter this experience","This is some Vanilla Sky shi...<br><br>Here are some notes and quotes for the lazy folks.<br><br>Key Takeaways<br>‚Ä¢ What the ‚Ä¶ ?
