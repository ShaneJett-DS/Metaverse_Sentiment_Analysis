Death is not only one of the most important aspects of being human but is an inevitable reality of the universe. Everything dies. The universe will die â€” no matter what we do, despite our incessant need to control our fate, we will never be able to stop entropy. Everything will die.

Death used to be less hidden from the human experience. For an incomprehensible length of time, adults and children alike saw their loved ones die and decay in front of them. However, at some point we started to dispose of our dead so as not to be reminded of their passing.

Now more than ever before we shove these uncomfortable truths away because we can't deal with reality. We've been told that denying death is the acceptable way to cope with loss. The reality is that the Instagram model will one day be shriveled and saggy. The art, artists, media/content and its creators will one day be gone and forgotten. Every record and memory of your existence will one day be erased from history without a trace. 

So many of us make ths mistake of falling for the illusion that frameworks, systems, or technology will save us from the great mortality of everything. We allow ourselves to be taken in by these distractions so as to perform a retroactive conceptual sleight of hand â€” to make the pain go away. This is a natural instinct. However, in the past we were forced to at least witness death and decay but now it's difficult to witness even if sought out but contrary to what we're taught, we must seek it out.

To find true comfort, we must first be uncomfortable. Be weary of comfort my friends, as the universe gives it so begrudgingly. To truly live, we must seek out death.","No, I don&#39;t think we need the real life equivalent of the perpetual resurrection of characters that Hollywood writers are so fond of these days.<br><br>Death is not only one of the most important aspects of being human but is an inevitable reality of the universe.
