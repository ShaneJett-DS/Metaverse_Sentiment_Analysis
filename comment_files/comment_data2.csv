I have been involved in graphics and 3D for more than 3 decades and very much excited by VR and promise and potential that it is finally starting to fulfill.

My observation is that a lot of VR 1st time experiences can seem to be quite profound, but the glow and novelty fades in short order. What we are seeing here looks to be a bit different.

The frustration of viewing this podcast, is in owning the hardware (Quest pro-2) seeing this, but not being able to access it, as it‚Äôs locked in a lab. 

I meet up with a friend of mine from New Zealand in VR and play put put golf, we both experience this as being somewhere, in a place ... together IE not sitting in our lounge room at home in different countries.

I still remember the visceral emotion experienced visiting the street where i grew up as child in google street view in VR several years ago, it was like a punch in the gut, the hairs standing up on your arm, a physical reaction. 

I see VR as an empathy engine. The experience of participating in the apollo 11 launch / moon landing, or a deep sea dive cannot be underestimated.
