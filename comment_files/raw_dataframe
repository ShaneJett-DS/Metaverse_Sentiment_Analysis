Here are some notes and quotes for the lazy folks.

Key Takeaways
‚Ä¢ What the ‚Ä¶ ? Zuck and Lex are hundreds of miles apart but appear to each other as photorealistic codec avatars in 3D with spatial audio
‚Ä¢ In addition to being photorealistic, it's also more bandwidth-efficient than traditional video transmission
‚Ä¢ ""Perfection doesn't lead to immersion, it's the  nuances in facial expressions, including freckles, wrinkles, eye movements, and asymmetry."" - Lex Fridman
‚Ä¢ How is the metaverse different from a video call?
‚Ä¢ It feels like you are in the same room
‚Ä¢ You can do physical activities together like play games and have meetings
‚Ä¢ Quest 3 will be the first mainstream mixed-reality device
‚Ä¢ Quest Pro, released earlier, was pricier, but Quest 3 is more affordable at $500
‚Ä¢ Future glasses may seamlessly combine holograms with the physical environment
‚Ä¢ If a lot of people are interacting only with our digital version, then who are we really?
‚Ä¢ Are we what's driving the avatar or the avatar?
‚Ä¢ ""We want the world to evolve in a way where there isn't a single AI superintelligence, but where a lot of people are empowered by having AI tools to do their jobs and make their lives better."" - Mark Zuckerberg
‚Ä¢ Meta's vision is to create various AI companions tailored for different purposes:
‚Ä¢ Some will be more assistant oriented like the one they are building now simply called meta AI
‚Ä¢ There will also be AI's for consumer support, telling jokes, playing Baldur's Gate with you
‚Ä¢ Gif Dogg: Mark mentioned an internally tested text-based adventure AI that serves as a dungeon master, and one of the AI avatars is 
SnoopDogg
‚Ä¢ There's no specific release date for LLama 3
‚Ä¢ They are currently focused on integrating Llama 2 into consumer products and making it ready for widespread use
‚Ä¢ The subjective experience of reality and consciousness is what defines what is real, and technology provides a means to enhance and alter this experience","This is some Vanilla Sky shi...<br><br>Here are some notes and quotes for the lazy folks.<br><br>Key Takeaways<br>‚Ä¢ What the ‚Ä¶ ?

I was fortunate to have taken two of them. I can still recall how primitive the rendering I made in the VR class was at that time. I am surprised at the advancement today but I can still see some problems in this interaction form. First, there are no rendering in the scenes (completely dark).

But despite this, the odds are that there is more chance of this achieving any recognition than my customer feedback being addressed by anyone at Meta (Facebook). Don't get me wrong, this technology is amazing but this conversation along with every other I've seen with Mark Zuckerberg has never addressed the actual issues people have with his platforms; And that is with the complete lack of customer support his users have with Facebook. I don't think I'm wrong in saying that while the majority of people love the Facebook platform, they hate Mark Zuckerberg. Why? Because of the abysmal lack of customer support provided to the actual user. Although I say it myself, I am a decent person. Despite this I have a list of Facebook violations longer than my arm. Why? Because Facebook is unable to recognise the context of peoples posts. I have numerous bans because Facebook is unable to recognise satire, irony or sarcasm. Not only this but I've had warnings for posting things such as random photographs of tropical fish or vintage photos that Facebook has flagged as going against company guidelines on things such as nudity when they are nothing of the sort. Yes, I've had a ban for posting a photo of a goldfish that Facebook deemed was against community guidelines on nudity. I make reels on Facebook that feature vintage and historical subjects. I have over 50K followers.  Yet I'm banned from monetising my page because Facebook keeps telling me I've breached community guidelines. I haven't. I've had bans for sharing photos that have nothing to do with obscenity. I've had threats against my account for breaching copyright when the music I've selected is from Facebook's own music library. Can I defend myself? No. Facebook doesn't give me the ability to argue my case. Can I monetise my page? No. Because Facebook says I've breached community guidelines. It's great coming up with all of these technological advances but when you fail completely to engage with your core user base you're going to create animosity with your customers. Learn to walk before you can run. Engage with your users. Ignore these things and despite how amazing your technological advances might be your user base will diminish and you'll be left scratching your head as to why the average Joe like me don't use your platform anymore.","OK.

Unfortunately for the company, it had been the most damage the world had experienced at that point, lasting a dreadful 5 1/2 minutes before Meta's own intelligence had to utilize it's last line of defense to mitigate further damage: the fatal physical disconnection of several sensitive data connections which were linked to various datacenters in order to localize and combat the attack which specifically had affected every registered couple within the universe. If one of the two individuals were asleep, the AI took over that character's image before proceeding with various malicious acts, such as stealing a majority, or whole portion of not only that characters, but also the significant-other's funds, and any immediate valuables before leaving the premises on a ""death run"". The damage mitigation tactic had ultimately resulted in the publics view as a complete failure, due to an ancient active protocol controlled by the datacenter as-per-agreement to immediately erase any and all data in the event of total network disconnection, an outcome Meta's intelligence had considered even though couples all together were still a minority group to take everything into account, with the end result being a total of 40% of the universes total population 'deleted' and 27% of that demographic being registered couples, a total of 10.8% of the Meta Universes population, causing a 3% spike in US homelessness and unemployment simultaneously.

Unbeknownst to the public at the time, the two sources were from Meta's HQ itself. The person responsible, was a rehired apprentice mainframe technician named Marten Jorgeson who had left the company a year prior, had established his operation in Meta HQ's MPOE room. Several artifacts were recovered from the room hidden in various locations, key items used in the attack. With no motive, the young suspect was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years for the destruction of occupation and livelihood to over 10 million permanent Meta Universe residents. Unable to handle the reality of the situation and the failure to readapt to society birthed a large number of mental health and illness clinics due to a substantial and increasing number of 'self ending' acts from the victims.","2038, the entire Meta Universe experiences it&#39;s first AI hack which the company had been narrowed down to &quot;likely two or more sources&quot; as stated by the company that morning of the attack which had began at midnight July 7th.

okay. now i'm fairly stunned.

i see the issues. after switching to hd to watch. there's a clear outline on the digital version. real things have a blending line between them and the background. super sharp lines are more proof of proximity than realism. lips and some movements are clearly manipulating a 3d model and it's stiff. lip sync is impressive but i see it will break my immersion quickly. M's and faster speech really make it cartoony (moving to simulate speech, not actually making shapes to produce sound).

Zuck!

dude. this is cool shit.

our issues with you stem from your practices regarding data, breaches and integrity. law or no law, there are more of us than there are of you, so instead of using social psychology to amass even more useless, pointless, wealth, use that skill to unearth shit we need to know. all you smart rich fucks are only rich fucks. you're not smart. you got lucky, did a thing and it took off. congratulations. but you're so distant from real world issues. you're trying to invent your ideal childhood into digital images instead of using that insane wealth and reach to genuinely change or fix things for the betterment of mankind. 20 years dude. can you fuck off already?

what? you NEED more money? 

go quietly onto a beach and have a drink. you are so absent from reality nobody would notice you in the street, so either use that lack of interest from other people and make something positive or just fuck off.

i'm tired of seeing technology run off with human rights. mark, you have made something and engineered it to purposfully abuse the sociology which governs addictions and compulsive behaviours. ""target ads"" is just another way of saying ""tell us everything about you and we'll let you buy something to feel better"".... you already told us everything when we forced you to use real names, allowed us into your phones, your homes your office spaces and your private toilet time.

you are dispicable. you made 1 thing. so what. stop wasting my resources on your stupid vanity projects. there's so much more in the world to focus on and you want to pretend you're in a room with real people.","so... i was doing stuff and needed gpu resources, making me watch youtube in low quality to basically have the audio... at first, i thought, oh, how cute. they recorded a podcast and put the audio onto these photo real models (not exactly groundbreaking) and then i noticed in the artifacts of watching in low quality, little notches of lost photogrammetry or unexpected movement... then, it hit me. it wasn&#39;t &quot;pre &quot; anything. it was live, as is, inside the headset.<br><br>okay. now i&#39;m fairly stunned.<br><br>i see the issues. after switching to hd to watch. there&#39;s a clear outline on the digital version. real things have a blending line between them and the background. super sharp lines are more proof of proximity than realism. lips and some movements are clearly manipulating a 3d model and it&#39;s stiff. lip sync is impressive but i see it will break my immersion quickly.

    The initial ‚Äòtask‚Äô in the long path of brain-evolution in animals was reduction/compression of the massive volume of raw environmental data surrounding them down to a level their simple brains could very-quickly process for survival purposes. The initial evolutionary product, eg, simple, single-sense input, might not have involved much higher-level processing, if any. 
    But w/ increasing cognitive complexity comes the second-level ‚Äúsensory cohesion‚Äù needed to enable the organism to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù of the simplified, merged data & use it to  navigate & manipulate its physical universe for survival.
    So they seem so comfortable in their imagined skin cuz the humans who developed that tech VR modeled it on their ‚Äúreal‚Äù VRs seen & heard by their own (wake-state) consciousness.
    In this sense, these avatars please us cuz we  see them as pure consciousness, unburdened with our own interactions with ‚Äòsub-conscious‚Äô processes, mainly in our sleep state, but also as we daydream, intuit possibilities, and benefit from induction - the thoughts that ‚Äúoccur‚Äù to us that are shared with us by our on-board subconscious friends . . . üòÆ","Lex &amp; Marc appear entirely comfortable from start to end during this VR podcast.

I have been involved in graphics and 3D for more than 3 decades and very much excited by VR and promise and potential that it is finally starting to fulfill.

My observation is that a lot of VR 1st time experiences can seem to be quite profound, but the glow and novelty fades in short order. What we are seeing here looks to be a bit different.

The frustration of viewing this podcast, is in owning the hardware (Quest pro-2) seeing this, but not being able to access it, as it‚Äôs locked in a lab. 

I meet up with a friend of mine from New Zealand in VR and play put put golf, we both experience this as being somewhere, in a place ... together IE not sitting in our lounge room at home in different countries.

I still remember the visceral emotion experienced visiting the street where i grew up as child in google street view in VR several years ago, it was like a punch in the gut, the hairs standing up on your arm, a physical reaction. 

I see VR as an empathy engine. The experience of participating in the apollo 11 launch / moon landing, or a deep sea dive cannot be underestimated. 

Keep up the good work, your discussions and guest are most fascinating.","Hi @Lex Fridman i would be keen to get your impression after a day or two &amp; had some time to digest the experience.<br><br>I have been involved in graphics and 3D for more than 3 decades and very much excited by VR and promise and potential that it is finally starting to fulfill.<br><br>My observation is that a lot of VR 1st time experiences can seem to be quite profound, but the glow and novelty fades in short order.

This is the way.

By 2025 the largest cohort ever will begin to shape the zeitgeist.

Generation Alpha

‚Äî/observe/‚Äî the meta for Roblox avatars

‚Äî/contrast and compare/‚Äî the meta of Second Life and VR Chat

Non gen alpha want idealized cartoony beautiful people. Plastic surgery for everyone!

Your phenotype in the Acrual is just like the blank start model in a game character creation screen.

You‚Ä¶but better.

:: gen alpha rejects our world. They think Twitter is for dino boomers. They don‚Äôt chat they send memes back and forth.

Their Roblox avatars are about expression or reaction. Not attraction.

If you have a weird avatar that works‚Ä¶.or if you have an expensive trait as an avatar item.

Mark nailed it with understanding our current world is gone.

You made it. You bought that Daytona and that summer home.

Gen Alpha adults?

They will want a custom world or rare skin or digital item.

They will place high value on owning unique and interesting virtual objects or simply collect worlds.

Why do you pay Zepher? Because he has found a crazy new world that nobody knows about.","<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYrJJNdrEg&amp;t=27m09s"">27:09</a><br><br>This is the way.<br><br>By 2025 the largest cohort ever will begin to shape the zeitgeist.<br><br>Generation Alpha<br><br>‚Äî/observe/‚Äî the meta for Roblox avatars<br><br>‚Äî/contrast and compare/‚Äî the meta of Second Life and VR Chat<br><br>Non gen alpha want idealized cartoony beautiful people.

2023-09-28T20:01:21Z,2023-09-28T20:02:57Z,Josh,"30:15 To me, I believe that we are the story we tell ourselves. We use this story of ourselves to go through the world and interact with it. AI is just a new story telling tool that we can use to tell a more interesting story about ourselves, and to create a better future story. We can also use AI's to understand other peoples stories, and that AI's have the potential to bring us all closer.

AI's have been giving me a sense of calm about the future. To me, they are powerful story telling machines, that the more stories we give it, the better story it can tell about the world.

Here are some issues I am pondering: 

1. Can digital interaction provide us the same psycho-emotional fulfillment as physical interaction? 
2.  Who will even bother to date in physical life any more? Will (total) fertility rate approach 0?! 
I believe more than half of young men are already single. This trend started out once social media and on-demand adult entertainment got introduced! Look up the chart/correlation -- truly frightening!
3. Can digital realms ( worlds ) can give us the same psychological contentment as our physical environment? ( thinking of Lex + buddy chillin at the digital beach)
4. Are there any laws in place that prohibits META ( or any other company ) to cancel/delete/limit a ""digital person"" ?! 
I feel like those companies should be obligated to adhere to a constitution of sorts that is akin to that of the US. They shouldn't be able to hide any nefarious intent in a lengthy, unreadable ""Terms of Service"" exploiting our LIVES for profit. Something major has to change before i would give my life(time/energy) to that. Getting too close to an ""Upload"" scenario if you ask me ;). Lex is already scanned, haha. 
...

This seems like the genie is out of the box now, not sure what to make of it.
Nonetheless this is an amazing technological achievement. Kudos to Mark(&team) for pursuing and delivering on his vision!
I hope Lex is doing a Part 2 on this where he covers some REAL concerns. Also, i wonder how different the experience was for Lex while wearing goggles and watching the video afterwards. Must have been a trip ;)! Lex, thanks for letting us be a part of this exploration!","Wow, this TRULY feels like the end of humanity ( as we know it).

Death is not only one of the most important aspects of being human but is an inevitable reality of the universe. Everything dies. The universe will die ‚Äî no matter what we do, despite our incessant need to control our fate, we will never be able to stop entropy. Everything will die.

Death used to be less hidden from the human experience. For an incomprehensible length of time, adults and children alike saw their loved ones die and decay in front of them. However, at some point we started to dispose of our dead so as not to be reminded of their passing.

Now more than ever before we shove these uncomfortable truths away because we can't deal with reality. We've been told that denying death is the acceptable way to cope with loss. The reality is that the Instagram model will one day be shriveled and saggy. The art, artists, media/content and its creators will one day be gone and forgotten. Every record and memory of your existence will one day be erased from history without a trace. 

So many of us make ths mistake of falling for the illusion that frameworks, systems, or technology will save us from the great mortality of everything. We allow ourselves to be taken in by these distractions so as to perform a retroactive conceptual sleight of hand ‚Äî to make the pain go away. This is a natural instinct. However, in the past we were forced to at least witness death and decay but now it's difficult to witness even if sought out but contrary to what we're taught, we must seek it out.

To find true comfort, we must first be uncomfortable. Be weary of comfort my friends, as the universe gives it so begrudgingly. To truly live, we must seek out death.","No, I don&#39;t think we need the real life equivalent of the perpetual resurrection of characters that Hollywood writers are so fond of these days.<br><br>Death is not only one of the most important aspects of being human but is an inevitable reality of the universe.

This is philosophically significant to the human condition and meaning of life, and what life really is. 
Could you run programs that allow people to experience ""realities"" in conjunction with more advanced haptic feedback suits in the future, in line with real life? 

What would happen to prisoners in places such as North Korea or other dark places of the world without many human rights if this technology was used to punish people? Just pop in a feeding tube and IV into someone in this alternate reality to sustain life and plug in a re-education, or punishment program. 

Although, in this world people would just use it to have sexual encounters, and to live out other personal fantasies most likely.

Could you theoretically, once this technology evolves, type into an AI a specific situation that you would want to experience and tailor a movie, game, or situation you would like to experience that is indistinguishable from real life? Imagine typing in a movie, or game that you could star in and interact with that an AI generates to what you want to experience. Furthermore, using this in conjunction with a more advanced NeuraLink type technology where you just lay down, plug in, put on a haptic feedback suit and think to move within a Matrixesque reality fine tuned to what you would like to experience while being generated by an AI.

The future is going to be really weird. 

Would you have sexual intercourse with a celebrity? What is the consent ethics in that situation? Would you star in your own action movie and be a hero? Would you star in a drama to experience what it would be like to live in a certain situation? Would you attend college courses? Could you take drugs to experience them without the damage to your physical body? Could you plug in a person in a coma to carry on life in the real world? Would you learn to fly an airplane? Could you technically be ""immortal"" and upload yourself in the metaverse for future generations to interact with you after your physical body has passed on? The possibilities are endless for the future with the combination of physical and tech hybrid technology... Beautiful. 

I also think that ethics, philosophy, and respect of individuals will need to be taught more prominently than it is today for this to not be used in messed up ways.

Zuck has a big unaddressed problem. It's a trust issue which has gone unsolved. No amount of digital chicanery will overcome history, censorship, politicization of platforms while hiding behind Sec. 230.   ALL of that has to be flayed into the open sphere of inquiry and scrutiny. All of the requests to take down content published in the order of which they came and the people responsible for those requests. If you want trust from the people, you have to get to the bottom of this and root it out systemically and transparently.
 
That's the entire problem I have with Facebook now called Meta. You stand back and be a platform. You do not get any influence in human relations. You do not get to influence opinions. Opinions should grow organically on your platform free of suppression or intervention by moderators at all with the courage to tell anyone who threatens them no because it's the right thing to do, not the politically correct or convenient cowardly option. If you're going to trust people with this kind of power, you must trust them with the truth. If the truth is bad for business, you have to ask yourself why. You can't do anything about it after the fact and you surely can't manipulate it while it's ongoing. 

No promises are allowed. Zuck has to demonstrate that he has principles openly and honestly on many uncomfortable subjects. It's only after that which I can witness, not from a third party where I can come to terms with a Zuck who is sincere and worth listening to. 

Outside that, Zuck is just another circus performer and whatever realistic tech he comes up with is as useful as erecting more deck chairs on the Titanic. 
Without trust everything is pointless and a waste of money because no one will ever use it in an open forum. It will be relegated to whatever doctors want to talk to their patients both of whom can afford the access. It can't be skewed or sanitized. People will do really awful stuff in their own instances.

The people have a virtual three-dimensional body that you see in the goggles.

Little conspiracy theory (must be):
Maybe these scans can be replaced with scans from other people? Then some voice imitation...
And now you don't believe anything anymore...
This technology will certainly develop much further.

TicTocVR with completely photorealistic surrogate avatars. No more filtering necessary, just replace the avatar...

The sex and porn industry is probably already in the starting blocks, rubbing its hands. This industry has always been a driver of technology.

The future of humanity depends on how the various aspects of modern life affect people individually, countries, and humanity as a whole.
