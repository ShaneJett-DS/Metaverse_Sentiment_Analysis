But despite this, the odds are that there is more chance of this achieving any recognition than my customer feedback being addressed by anyone at Meta (Facebook). Don't get me wrong, this technology is amazing but this conversation along with every other I've seen with Mark Zuckerberg has never addressed the actual issues people have with his platforms; And that is with the complete lack of customer support his users have with Facebook. I don't think I'm wrong in saying that while the majority of people love the Facebook platform, they hate Mark Zuckerberg. Why? Because of the abysmal lack of customer support provided to the actual user. Although I say it myself, I am a decent person. Despite this I have a list of Facebook violations longer than my arm. Why? Because Facebook is unable to recognise the context of peoples posts. I have numerous bans because Facebook is unable to recognise satire, irony or sarcasm. Not only this but I've had warnings for posting things such as random photographs of tropical fish or vintage photos that Facebook has flagged as going against company guidelines on things such as nudity when they are nothing of the sort. Yes, I've had a ban for posting a photo of a goldfish that Facebook deemed was against community guidelines on nudity. I make reels on Facebook that feature vintage and historical subjects. I have over 50K followers.  Yet I'm banned from monetising my page because Facebook keeps telling me I've breached community guidelines. I haven't. I've had bans for sharing photos that have nothing to do with obscenity. I've had threats against my account for breaching copyright when the music I've selected is from Facebook's own music library. Can I defend myself? No. Facebook doesn't give me the ability to argue my case. Can I monetise my page? No. Because Facebook says I've breached community guidelines. It's great coming up with all of these technological advances but when you fail completely to engage with your core user base you're going to create animosity with your customers. Learn to walk before you can run. Engage with your users. Ignore these things and despite how amazing your technological advances might be your user base will diminish and you'll be left scratching your head as to why the average Joe like me don't use your platform anymore.","OK.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, this technology is amazing but this conversation along with every other I&#39;ve seen with Mark Zuckerberg has never addressed the actual issues people have with his platforms; And that is with the complete lack of customer support his users have with Facebook. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m wrong in saying that while the majority of people love the Facebook platform, they hate Mark Zuckerberg. Why? Because of the abysmal lack of customer support provided to the actual user. Although I say it myself, I am a decent person. Despite this I have a list of Facebook violations longer than my arm. Why? Because Facebook is unable to recognise the context of peoples posts. I have numerous bans because Facebook is unable to recognise satire, irony or sarcasm. Not only this but I&#39;ve had warnings for posting things such as random photographs of tropical fish or vintage photos that Facebook has flagged as going against company guidelines on things such as nudity when they are nothing of the sort. Yes, I&#39;ve had a ban for posting a photo of a goldfish that Facebook deemed was against community guidelines on nudity. I make reels on Facebook that feature vintage and historical subjects. I have over 50K followers.  Yet I&#39;m banned from monetising my page because Facebook keeps telling me I&#39;ve breached community guidelines. I haven&#39;t. I&#39;ve had bans for sharing photos that have nothing to do with obscenity. I&#39;ve had threats against my account for breaching copyright when the music I&#39;ve selected is from Facebook&#39;s own music library. Can I defend myself? No. Facebook doesn&#39;t give me the ability to argue my case. Can I monetise my page? No. Because Facebook says I&#39;ve breached community guidelines. It&#39;s great coming up with all of these technological advances but when you fail completely to engage with your core user base you&#39;re going to create animosity with your customers. Learn to walk before you can run. Engage with your users. Ignore these things and despite how amazing your technological advances might be your user base will diminish and you&#39;ll be left scratching your head as to why the average Joe like me don&#39;t use your platform anymore.",none,0,UCQ_9wI5jo-yWBuZkpzkG_PQ
