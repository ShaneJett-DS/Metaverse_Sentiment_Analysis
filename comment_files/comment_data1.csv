1. Lex probably isn't wearing his iconic suit becuase it would be hard to distinguish him from the black environment (he would look like a floating head.) Alternatively, it's because when he got the scan done, this was the outfit he was in and they wanted consistency between the avatar and Lex.
2. Lex's avatar seems to be a higher quality (lighting, details, pixel density) than Mark's avatar. My guess is this is because Mark had his avatar done months before Lex, back with the tech was earlier in development.
