Unfortunately for the company, it had been the most damage the world had experienced at that point, lasting a dreadful 5 1/2 minutes before Meta's own intelligence had to utilize it's last line of defense to mitigate further damage: the fatal physical disconnection of several sensitive data connections which were linked to various datacenters in order to localize and combat the attack which specifically had affected every registered couple within the universe. If one of the two individuals were asleep, the AI took over that character's image before proceeding with various malicious acts, such as stealing a majority, or whole portion of not only that characters, but also the significant-other's funds, and any immediate valuables before leaving the premises on a ""death run"". The damage mitigation tactic had ultimately resulted in the publics view as a complete failure, due to an ancient active protocol controlled by the datacenter as-per-agreement to immediately erase any and all data in the event of total network disconnection, an outcome Meta's intelligence had considered even though couples all together were still a minority group to take everything into account, with the end result being a total of 40% of the universes total population 'deleted' and 27% of that demographic being registered couples, a total of 10.8% of the Meta Universes population, causing a 3% spike in US homelessness and unemployment simultaneously.

Unbeknownst to the public at the time, the two sources were from Meta's HQ itself. The person responsible, was a rehired apprentice mainframe technician named Marten Jorgeson who had left the company a year prior, had established his operation in Meta HQ's MPOE room. Several artifacts were recovered from the room hidden in various locations, key items used in the attack. With no motive, the young suspect was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years for the destruction of occupation and livelihood to over 10 million permanent Meta Universe residents. Unable to handle the reality of the situation and the failure to readapt to society birthed a large number of mental health and illness clinics due to a substantial and increasing number of 'self ending' acts from the victims.","2038, the entire Meta Universe experiences it&#39;s first AI hack which the company had been narrowed down to &quot;likely two or more sources&quot; as stated by the company that morning of the attack which had began at midnight July 7th.

okay. now i'm fairly stunned.

i see the issues. after switching to hd to watch. there's a clear outline on the digital version. real things have a blending line between them and the background. super sharp lines are more proof of proximity than realism. lips and some movements are clearly manipulating a 3d model and it's stiff. lip sync is impressive but i see it will break my immersion quickly. M's and faster speech really make it cartoony (moving to simulate speech, not actually making shapes to produce sound).

Zuck!

dude. this is cool shit.

our issues with you stem from your practices regarding data, breaches and integrity. law or no law, there are more of us than there are of you, so instead of using social psychology to amass even more useless, pointless, wealth, use that skill to unearth shit we need to know. all you smart rich fucks are only rich fucks. you're not smart. you got lucky, did a thing and it took off. congratulations. but you're so distant from real world issues. you're trying to invent your ideal childhood into digital images instead of using that insane wealth and reach to genuinely change or fix things for the betterment of mankind. 20 years dude. can you fuck off already?

what? you NEED more money? 

go quietly onto a beach and have a drink. you are so absent from reality nobody would notice you in the street, so either use that lack of interest from other people and make something positive or just fuck off.

i'm tired of seeing technology run off with human rights. mark, you have made something and engineered it to purposfully abuse the sociology which governs addictions and compulsive behaviours. ""target ads"" is just another way of saying ""tell us everything about you and we'll let you buy something to feel better"".... you already told us everything when we forced you to use real names, allowed us into your phones, your homes your office spaces and your private toilet time.
