AI is just a new story telling tool that we can use to tell a more interesting story about ourselves, and to create a better future story. We can also use AI's to understand other peoples stories, and that AI's have the potential to bring us all closer.

AI's have been giving me a sense of calm about the future. To me, they are powerful story telling machines, that the more stories we give it, the better story it can tell about the world. It will be able to tell future stories that will benefit humanity. It can also tell powerfully terrible stories guided by terrible people.
I love the idea that if everyone is powerful, no one is powerful. I feel like humanity wants to tell a good story, that there are more people who want to do good and help others compared to those who want to cause pain and hurt others.
