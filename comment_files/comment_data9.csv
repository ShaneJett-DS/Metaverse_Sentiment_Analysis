The main challenge in that is not technology. Human evolution developed such convergence naturally by adding value or constraints and within their evolutionary reward reward naturally (people gather when on eating, hunting or gather together) .. the technological constraints defined other forms of convergence (people attend together to watch movie at the cinema theater) .. or travel to watch a football match. None of these issues is driven by technology but by the tendency to collective perceptional convergence.
