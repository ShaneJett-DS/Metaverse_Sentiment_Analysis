All the current global communication systems are too shallow in their information transfer and thus only allow for performative narcissism. This is the primary reason why twitter rose to be the most prominent medium of global communication. Being the shallowest one best allowed the narcissistic rent seekers to perform their puppet shows.  Full presence VR, as demonstrated, transfers a level of depth that is about as close as we can get to in person interaction. This depth of information transfer makes it extremely difficult for con artists and bots to hijack and take over things. Through increasing the depth of information transfer, we can achieve a much more human level of connection and interaction. 
I always point to the example of Daryl Davis, the black man who convinced over 200 KKK members to leave and renounce the organization. You could have confronted those people with all of the information of the most qualified and educated people, biologists, historians, philosophers, you name it. All that would have accomplished would have been to strengthen their conviction in the organization. But Daryl succeeded through the simple act of interacting at the human level, and in time becoming their friend. Full presence VR is the tech with the greatest potential to enable this interaction and connection at a global scale.","People rightfully shit on Zuck.
