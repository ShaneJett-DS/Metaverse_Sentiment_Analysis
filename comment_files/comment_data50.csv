Zuck has a big unaddressed problem. It's a trust issue which has gone unsolved. No amount of digital chicanery will overcome history, censorship, politicization of platforms while hiding behind Sec. 230.   ALL of that has to be flayed into the open sphere of inquiry and scrutiny. All of the requests to take down content published in the order of which they came and the people responsible for those requests. If you want trust from the people, you have to get to the bottom of this and root it out systemically and transparently.
 
That's the entire problem I have with Facebook now called Meta. You stand back and be a platform. You do not get any influence in human relations. You do not get to influence opinions. Opinions should grow organically on your platform free of suppression or intervention by moderators at all with the courage to tell anyone who threatens them no because it's the right thing to do, not the politically correct or convenient cowardly option. If you're going to trust people with this kind of power, you must trust them with the truth. If the truth is bad for business, you have to ask yourself why. You can't do anything about it after the fact and you surely can't manipulate it while it's ongoing. 

No promises are allowed. Zuck has to demonstrate that he has principles openly and honestly on many uncomfortable subjects. It's only after that which I can witness, not from a third party where I can come to terms with a Zuck who is sincere and worth listening to. 

Outside that, Zuck is just another circus performer and whatever realistic tech he comes up with is as useful as erecting more deck chairs on the Titanic. 
Without trust everything is pointless and a waste of money because no one will ever use it in an open forum. It will be relegated to whatever doctors want to talk to their patients both of whom can afford the access. It can't be skewed or sanitized. People will do really awful stuff in their own instances. Zuck has to be fine with that and accept it as how people are.","I&#39;ll give Zuck all the credit in the world for pursuing something absolutely interesting.

I know but I won't tell until... JUST KIDDING! What might work is workshops? You know, when there is a new recording studio program being released, there are workshops at music stores where people can sign up and a representant from the company gives a seminar---sometimes for a few days. Why not have a workshop sort of thing where FACEBOOK would have a stand at a place or location or even a store where computer products are sold and it might be interesting for people to see META-WORKSHOP this Friday at 18 h 00 for all those that sign up! Why do I say this? Well, some people might be weary of yet another new set of things or special program to be involved in. If you had workshops around your country it might bring in stray cats and it also would boost someone's lagging business if that was the case. You know what I mean, have it serve a duel purpose...","Hey Mark, I read yesterday that Metaverse is slow taking off. You know what might work to kick-start your projects?
