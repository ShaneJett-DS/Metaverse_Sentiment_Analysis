Here are some issues I am pondering: 

1. Can digital interaction provide us the same psycho-emotional fulfillment as physical interaction? 
2.  Who will even bother to date in physical life any more? Will (total) fertility rate approach 0?! 
I believe more than half of young men are already single. This trend started out once social media and on-demand adult entertainment got introduced! Look up the chart/correlation -- truly frightening!
3. Can digital realms ( worlds ) can give us the same psychological contentment as our physical environment? ( thinking of Lex + buddy chillin at the digital beach)
4. Are there any laws in place that prohibits META ( or any other company ) to cancel/delete/limit a ""digital person"" ?! 
I feel like those companies should be obligated to adhere to a constitution of sorts that is akin to that of the US. They shouldn't be able to hide any nefarious intent in a lengthy, unreadable ""Terms of Service"" exploiting our LIVES for profit. Something major has to change before i would give my life(time/energy) to that. Getting too close to an ""Upload"" scenario if you ask me ;). Lex is already scanned, haha. 
...

This seems like the genie is out of the box now, not sure what to make of it.
Nonetheless this is an amazing technological achievement. Kudos to Mark(&team) for pursuing and delivering on his vision!
I hope Lex is doing a Part 2 on this where he covers some REAL concerns. Also, i wonder how different the experience was for Lex while wearing goggles and watching the video afterwards.
