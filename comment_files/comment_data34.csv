First he connected everyone through Facebook and now people create businesses there and everything and now I can literally visit my grandmother in Albania and sit with her like I’m literally there. Just hanging out with the guys and talking shit, working and meetings in this. Imagine the cost reduction for companies with no screens, no physical office and just pure profit xD I swear the more I think about it it just gets crazier. And not to forget the dude is working his ass off in MMA. Well done mark! I just hope u are not tricking people and that your genuinely a good guy. Always do the right thing don’t let the government mess with you !",none,5,UCOsdEssued8G6di0hoNHP3A

In the Nature of Reality segment when you asked if it would be a possibility to speak to dead loved ones it rang a warning bell in my mind.  Like all roads of good intentions it usually leads to Hell.  The ability to copy a dead person to a digital avatar, and have it be something other then a cheap knock off, is mind boggling.  What type of tech would it take to be able to do it? What amount of data of this person would it require? Brain scans? Are we uploading periodic scans of our brains throughout our lives, since death is a constant and random consequence of life?  The people in charge of these scans, are they selling this data to brokers? Are uploads the only data stream, or is there a possibility of downloads as well?  Are we going in the direction of tech-immortality?

Death is a part of life, and one of the hardest lessons to learn as a person is how to deal with the death of the people you love.  What would this do to peoples ability to cope with death if they can escape the reality of life with a virtual one?  Some of the hardest lessons in my life was learning how to continue living a positive life after watching my father die.  This is a real slippery slope.","Interesting.
