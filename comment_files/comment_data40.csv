This is philosophically significant to the human condition and meaning of life, and what life really is. 
Could you run programs that allow people to experience ""realities"" in conjunction with more advanced haptic feedback suits in the future, in line with real life? 

What would happen to prisoners in places such as North Korea or other dark places of the world without many human rights if this technology was used to punish people? Just pop in a feeding tube and IV into someone in this alternate reality to sustain life and plug in a re-education, or punishment program. 

Although, in this world people would just use it to have sexual encounters, and to live out other personal fantasies most likely.

Could you theoretically, once this technology evolves, type into an AI a specific situation that you would want to experience and tailor a movie, game, or situation you would like to experience that is indistinguishable from real life? Imagine typing in a movie, or game that you could star in and interact with that an AI generates to what you want to experience. Furthermore, using this in conjunction with a more advanced NeuraLink type technology where you just lay down, plug in, put on a haptic feedback suit and think to move within a Matrixesque reality fine tuned to what you would like to experience while being generated by an AI.

The future is going to be really weird. 

Would you have sexual intercourse with a celebrity? What is the consent ethics in that situation? Would you star in your own action movie and be a hero? Would you star in a drama to experience what it would be like to live in a certain situation? Would you attend college courses? Could you take drugs to experience them without the damage to your physical body? Could you plug in a person in a coma to carry on life in the real world? Would you learn to fly an airplane? Could you technically be ""immortal"" and upload yourself in the metaverse for future generations to interact with you after your physical body has passed on? The possibilities are endless for the future with the combination of physical and tech hybrid technology... Beautiful. 

I also think that ethics, philosophy, and respect of individuals will need to be taught more prominently than it is today for this to not be used in messed up ways. 

Man, this joint is hitting hard.","I&#39;m in awe...
