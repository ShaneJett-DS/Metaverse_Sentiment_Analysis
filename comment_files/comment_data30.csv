This is the way.

By 2025 the largest cohort ever will begin to shape the zeitgeist.

Generation Alpha

‚Äî/observe/‚Äî the meta for Roblox avatars

‚Äî/contrast and compare/‚Äî the meta of Second Life and VR Chat

Non gen alpha want idealized cartoony beautiful people. Plastic surgery for everyone!

Your phenotype in the Acrual is just like the blank start model in a game character creation screen.

You‚Ä¶but better.

:: gen alpha rejects our world. They think Twitter is for dino boomers. They don‚Äôt chat they send memes back and forth.

Their Roblox avatars are about expression or reaction. Not attraction.

If you have a weird avatar that works‚Ä¶.or if you have an expensive trait as an avatar item.

Mark nailed it with understanding our current world is gone.

You made it. You bought that Daytona and that summer home.

Gen Alpha adults?

They will want a custom world or rare skin or digital item.

They will place high value on owning unique and interesting virtual objects or simply collect worlds.

Why do you pay Zepher? Because he has found a crazy new world that nobody knows about.","<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVYrJJNdrEg&amp;t=27m09s"">27:09</a><br><br>This is the way.<br><br>By 2025 the largest cohort ever will begin to shape the zeitgeist.<br><br>Generation Alpha<br><br>‚Äî/observe/‚Äî the meta for Roblox avatars<br><br>‚Äî/contrast and compare/‚Äî the meta of Second Life and VR Chat<br><br>Non gen alpha want idealized cartoony beautiful people.
